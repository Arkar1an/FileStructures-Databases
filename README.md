# FileStructures-Databases
Final database project
## About
Final project for database project. Professor Wang gave written requirements and models were designed based on those requirements:
* Entity Relation Model
* Relational Model

Finally SQL was used to implement the [DDL](tables.sql) requirements and [initial values](records.sql). Simple HTML and PHP were used to query the database and display results.
